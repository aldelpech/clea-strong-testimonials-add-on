== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= why would I use this =

Strong Testimonials is a great plugin qith plenty of possibilities. 
Yet, it has only one taxonomy. In a project I needed 2 taxonomies : 
* the provided taxonomy (categories) to set the views 
* a new taxonomy which would be an additional criteria to show testimonials. 
 
That's all.

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.
